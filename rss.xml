Completely isolated from the rest of the world, the Residency allows its artists to work in a remote space with no tangible lines of communication to the outside world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2d759350ce98ca3bc139cec56370ae7702fae3f5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
